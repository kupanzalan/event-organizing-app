            <p class="general">The Golden Retriever is a medium-large gun dog that was bred to retrieve shot waterfowl, such as ducks and upland game birds, during hunting and
                 shooting parties. The name "retriever" refers to the breed's ability to retrieve shot game undamaged due to their soft mouth. Golden retrievers 
                 have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards. They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner
                  coat that provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water. 
                  Golden retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or country environments. They shed copiously, particularly at the change of
                   seasons, and require fairly regular grooming. The Golden Retriever was originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century.</p>

            <p class="desc">The Golden Retriever is a medium-large, strongly built breed with a dense, water-repellant wavy coat. As a dog with origins in pedigree breeding, 
                and owing to its widespread historical popularity, some regional variations have emerged in the breed; therefore, the three subtypes of the 
                Golden Retriever reflect the typical variations in dimensions and coat. However, all Golden Retrievers are blonde, yellow, or gold in colour, 
                and all subtypes are susceptible to the same health problems.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>General</h3>
            <p class="general">The Border Collie is a working and herding dog breed developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region, for herding livestock, especially sheep.
                Considered highly intelligent, extremely energetic, acrobatic and athletic, they frequently compete with great success in sheepdog trials and dog sports. 
                They are often cited as the most intelligent of all domestic dogs. Border Collies continue to be employed in their traditional work of herding 
                livestock throughout the world and are kept as pets.</p>

            <p class="desc"><em>In general</em>, Border Collies are medium-sized dogs with a moderate amount of coat, which is more often thick and prone to shedding. They have a double coat
                 that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled. While black and white is the most commonly seen color pattern of the Border Collie, 
                 the breed appears in just about any color and pattern known to occur in dogs. Some of these include black tricolor (black/tan/white), liver and white, 
                 and red tricolor (red/tan/white) which have also been seen regularly, and other colours such as blue, lilac, red merle, blue merle, brindle, and Australian 
                 red (also known as ee red, blonde, recessive red, or gold) which is seen less frequently. Some border collies may also have single-color coats.</p>

                    <p>Border Collies require considerably more daily physical exercise and mental stimulation than many other breeds. The border collie is widely 
                        considered to be the most intelligent dog breed. The border collie ranks 1st in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being part of 
                        the top 10 brightest dogs. Although the primary role of the border collie is to herd livestock, the breed is becoming increasingly popular as a 
                        companion animal.</p>

        <h2>German shepherd</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>General</h3>
            <p class="general">The German Shepherd (German: Deutscher Schäferhund, German pronunciation: [ˈdɔʏtʃɐ ˈʃɛːfɐˌhʊnt]) is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog
                 that originated in Germany. According to the FCI, the breed's English language name is German Shepherd Dog. The breed was officially
                  known as the "Alsatian Wolf Dog" in the UK from after the First World War until 1977 when its name was changed back to German Shepherd.
                   Despite its wolf-like appearance, the German Shepherd is a relatively modern breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899.</p>

            <p class="desc">German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs. The breed standard height at the withers is 60–65 cm (24–26 in) for males, 
                and 55–60 cm (22–24 in) for females. German Shepherds are longer than they are tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to ​8 1⁄2. 
                The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard weight range. They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong 
                jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown. The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but 
                they often are pulled back during movement. A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at 
                a fast pace as well as stalking. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.</p>

                    <p>German Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self assured. The breed is marked by a willingness 
                    to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. 
                    They can become overprotective of their family and territory, especially if not socialized correctly. They are not inclined to become 
                    immediate friends with strangers. German Shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as protective of their owners.</p>
