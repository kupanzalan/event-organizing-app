        <h2>German shepherd</h2>
        <p>German Shepherds have a double coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants: medium and long. 
        The gene for long hair is recessive, and therefore the long-haired variety is rarer. Treatment of the long-haired variation differs across 
        standards; it is accepted but does not compete against standard-coated dogs under the German and UK Kennel Clubs while it can compete with 
        standard-coated dogs, but is considered a fault, in the American Kennel Club. The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as 
        the variety b, while the short-haired type is listed as the variety a.

        Most commonly, German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most color varieties have black masks and black body markings 
        which can range from a classic "saddle" to an overall "blanket". Rarer color variations include the sable, pure-black, pure-white, 
        liver, silver, blue, and panda varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the
        blue and liver are considered t o be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation
