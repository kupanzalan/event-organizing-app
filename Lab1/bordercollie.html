        <h2>Border collie</h2>
        Eye color varies from brown to blue, and occasionally eyes of differing color occur; this is usually seen with merles. The ears of the border collie are also 
        variable â€” some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears, and others semi-erect ears (similar to those of the rough collie).
         Although working border collie handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the 
         unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog), in general, the American Border Collie Association considers a dog's 
         appearance to be irrelevant. Instead, it is considered more useful to identify a working border collie by its attitude and ability.

        Dogs bred for show are more homogeneous in appearance than working border collies, since to win in conformation showing they must conform closely to breed 
        club standards that are specific on many points of the structure, coat, and color. Kennel clubs specify, for example, that the border collie must have a "keen 
        and intelligent" expression, and that the preferred eye color is dark brown. In deference to the dog's working origin, scars and broken teeth received in the 
        line of duty are not to be counted against a border collie in the show ring. The males' height from withers comes from 48 to 56 centimetres (19 to 22 in), 
        females from 46 to 53 centimetres (18 to 21 in).
